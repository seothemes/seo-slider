== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to enable unsupported HTML tags in slider content? =
By default, SEO Slider uses the same markup filters as the WordPress editor: do_shortcode, wp_kses_post & wpautop. To remove these, you can use the 'seo_slider_content_output' filter by adding the following to your child themes functions.php file:

`add_filter('seo_slider_content_output', function( $default, $raw ) {
    return $raw;
} );`

= How is this slider SEO friendly? =
SEO Slider has been built with SEO in mind. We've taken extra care to ensure that it's as lightweight as possible with only one JavaScript file and one CSS file. We've also added some extra schema markup to help search engines understand the content. While no slider is perfect for SEO, we'll do our best to make sure this plugin is as SEO friendly as possible.

= Is this plugin accessibility ready? =
This plugin uses the Slick Slider JavaScript plugin which supports keyboard arrow key navigation. Give it a try yourself at https://demo.seothemes.com/corporate-pro/ using just the keyboard to navigate through the slides.
